# VBA-challenge
Module 2 challenge

Description: 

I added to this repository:
*The screenshots of the results of the Multiple_year_stock_data Excel file (I wasn't able to upload the file because is too big)
*The Alphabetical_testing, this file has the same script that I use to solve the challenge and works the same way
*The script, is divided into 2 subroutines, one for the button (this just calls the same sub in each sheet) and the other one does 
 all the steps in the challenge, the script has comments in each part so itÂ´s easier to identify what is doing.
